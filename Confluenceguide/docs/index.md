# What is Confluence?

Confluence is a wiki application (software designed for collaborative editing in a browser). Confluence is developed by the company Atlassian (also famous for the creation of the working collaboratively and issue-tracking tool JIRA) and allows users to work together using only a web browser. So, what are the differences between Confluence and JIRA?

## Differences between Confluence and JIRA:

1. Confluence and JIRA are separate licenses (A JIRA license does not include A Confluence license);
2. Confluence serves as a digital brain for the organization (the entire work team can store workflows, documentation data, and much other organizational information) while JIRA serves as an issue-tracking and managing tool.

## Confluence terms

Before concentrating on the interface it is vital to explain the necessary terms to use Confluence effectively.

- **Pages-** the place where all of the content inside of Confluence will be present (text, images, tables, etc.).

- **Macros-** dynamic content on pages (ex. connects JIRA with Confluence and all the changes are automatically transmitted from JIRA to Confluence and the other way round).
  Spaces- the place where pages are situated.

- **A blog-** is a type of content in Confluence that allows users to create and share articles, news updates, and personal insights. Blogs are usually shown in chronological order, with the most recent entry at the top.

- **Permissions-** Confluence has a strong permissions system in place that governs who may see, edit, and perform various activities on pages and spaces. Administrators can set access levels to ensure that only authorized users can read and alter material.

Confluence is a centralized knowledge repository that enables teams to capture, store, and retrieve useful information, documentation, and best practices. It promotes cooperation and reduces knowledge silos by facilitating knowledge exchange across departments, teams, and entire enterprises. So, it is pivotal to have an understanding of the Confluence interface and its main function for effective and fruitful work.
