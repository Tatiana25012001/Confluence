**Personal spaces** (or also team spaces) are a way of organizing all the things you want to store. In Confluence the pages keep your content and all the content is situated in spaces. personal spaces can be created by any user. Team spaces are designed to be global across the entire company and need to be created by an admin. But both personal and team spaces can contain the same type of content (pages can contain images, text, etc.).

## To create a personal space:

1. Click the <img src="\src\img\profile.png" alt="profile" width="40" height="30" style="border: 1px solid black;"> icon and select **Add Personal Space** from the dropdown list.
   <img src="\src\img\addpersonspace.png" alt="addpersonspace" width="600" height="800" style="border: 1px solid black;">

2. Write your name in the field and click the **Create** button.
   <img src="\src\img\createperson.png" alt="createperson" width="600" height="800" style="border: 1px solid black;">

The personal space is created.
