## Confluence is very slow

**Solution:** Check the server resources that are hosting Confluence. Make sure you have enough memory, CPU power, and network bandwidth. Examine the database's setup and performance. Index tweaking, cleansing of redundant data, or increasing allocated database resources may be required.

## I have problems with authorization and access to Confluence

**Solution:** In Confluence, review user access rights and roles. Ensure that groups and roles are properly assigned and that suitable permissions are set. Perform test scenarios and fixes to detect potential configuration or setup errors if authentication or access issues arise.

## My data has been lost/unrecovered

**Solution:** Confluence backups should be produced regularly and saved in a secure and easily accessible location. Check that the repair techniques function properly. Set up monitoring techniques in Confluence to notify you of probable problems and failures. This enables rapid response to potential problems and prevents data loss.

## I have conflicts while editing documents in groups simultaneously

**Solution:** To avoid disagreements, make sure users are aware of the option to lock a page before updating and that they follow agreed-upon processes. Provide collaborative editing feature training for users, emphasizing the necessity of communication and collaboration when working on shared documents.

## It is difficult for me to find any information in Confluence

**Solution:** In Confluence, create a well-defined information architecture that includes a logical hierarchy, categorization, and consistent naming conventions. Encourage users to create and organize material following these principles.
