    <h1>#Welcome to Google Docs</h1>
    Google Docs is a useful web-based application in which documents and
    spreadsheets can be created, edited, and stored online. Google Docs users
    can import, create, edit, and update documents and spreadsheets in various
    fonts and file formats, combining text with formulas, lists, tables, and
    images. Google Docs allows the creation of collaborative projects in which
    multiple authors work together in real-time from geographically diverse
    locations. Because documents are stored online and can also be stored on
    users' computers, there is no risk of total data loss as a result of any
    problems with the connection. ## Google Docs benefits: - Work can be
    published as a Web page or as a print-ready manuscript. - Google Docs is a
    simple file-and-folder system. Users can create folders and subfolders for
    all their files. - The application supports opening and exporting two ISO
    standard document formats: OpenDocument and Office Open XML. - Google Docs
    serves as a collaborative tool for multiple users editing documents in real
    time. - Documents can be created, imported or sent.
